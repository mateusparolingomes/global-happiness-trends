# 🌍 Global Happiness Trends Dashboard

This project explores and visualizes global happiness trends from 2015 to 2023 using data from the [World Happiness Report dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/global-happiness-scores-and-factors?select=WHR_2023.csv).

## 📊 Project Overview

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights:
- Global and country-specific happiness scores
- Key influencing factors (GDP per capita, life expectancy, social support, etc.)
- Correlation between happiness and these variables
- Trends over time and regional comparisons

The dashboard enables easy exploration of how happiness scores have evolved across regions and how various socioeconomic indicators correlate with happiness.

## 📁 Dataset

The original dataset contains yearly CSV files from 2015 to 2023. Each file includes:
- Country name
- Year
- Happiness score
- Socioeconomic and perception-based factors

All datasets were cleaned and merged into a unified format for analysis.

## 🔧 Key Features

- Time-series analysis of average happiness scores
- Top 5 happiest countries visualized
- Correlation matrix between happiness and other variables
- Scatter plot comparison: GDP per capita vs Happiness
- Interactive country filter and date slicer

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** for dashboard creation and data visualization
- **Excel** for initial checks

## 🚀 Business Objectives

This analysis was built to support data-driven policymaking and strategic prioritization for public well-being. The goals include:

- Identifying **key levers of happiness** (e.g., GDP per capita, freedom of choice) to guide socioeconomic development strategies
- Enabling **comparative benchmarking** across countries and regions over time
- Highlighting areas of **inequality or unexpected performance** (e.g., high GDP but low happiness) to focus intervention
- Empowering stakeholders—governments, NGOs, and businesses—with a clear view of how social, economic, and governance metrics impact collective well-being
