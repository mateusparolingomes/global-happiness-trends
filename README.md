# 🌍 Global Happiness Trends Dashboard

This project explores and visualizes global happiness trends from 2015 to 2023 using data from the [World Happiness Report dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/global-happiness-scores-and-factors?select=WHR_2023.csv).

## 📊 Project Overview

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights:
- Global and country-specific happiness scores
- Key influencing factors (GDP per capita, life expectancy, social support, etc.)
- Correlation between happiness and these variables
- Trends over time and regional comparisons

The dashboard enables easy exploration of how happiness scores have evolved across regions and how various socioeconomic indicators correlate with happiness.
